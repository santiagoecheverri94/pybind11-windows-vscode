# pybind11-windows-vscode
Simple Git-History-Based Tutorial on how to use `pybind11` for Python/C++ interoperability in Windows with VS Code.

__Important:__ You need to open vscode from visual studio developer command prompt for this tutorial to work. See docs here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc#_check-your-microsoft-visual-c-installation.

In the docs, they use the default 32-bit developer command prompt. Since we use 64-bit Python in this tutorial, you'd have to open vscode from 64-bit developer comand prompt.
